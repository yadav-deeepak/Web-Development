// EJS(Embedded JavaScript Templates)
# Templating 
-> EJS(Embedded JavaScript Templates)
-> EJS is a simple templating language that lets you  genrerate HTML markup with plain JavaScript.
-> Whenever similar layouts are used in multiple pages the we simply create the template of the page and render the information in it.
-> Install EJS : npm i ejs 

# Using EJS 
-> app.set("view engine","ejs"); //This will set the view engine as EJS

app.get("/",(req,res)=>{
    res.render("home.ejs"); // this will render the home.ejs page when the get request is made on the home page.
});

-> Using ejs we don't send responses we render responses.
-> We use res.render to render changes and we render home.ejs file .
-> We need to create a "views" folder in our EJS folder because view engine expects that all our templates should be present in the "views" folder.
-> If we want we can set the name as something else but we use the default name(views).
-> To create ejs template we save the file with .ejs extension.
Eg: home.ejs . 
//We will create a mix code of html and js in this home.ejs file.

# How does res.render will know where the file is ?
-> When the code is excuted then by default express will send the views folder and inside it , it will search for home.ejs folder.

Note: If we start our server from any other directory then we will get error because express will search for the views folder in the directory from which the server has been started .
-> To solve this :
-> we need to require the path package and then set the views path .
Eg: // index.js
const path = require("path");
app.set("views", path.join(__dirname,"/views"));


# Views Directory 
-> const path = require("path");
app.set("views", path.join(__dirname,"/views"));
// __dirname this includes the path of the index.js i.e; MERN/EJS/

-> We are adding the views path in it .
MERN/EJS/views using path.join we are joining these two and we are telling express the exact path of our views folder.

# Interpolation Syntax 
-> Interpolation refers to embedding expessions into marked up text.
-> Using EJS we are going to make our code dynamic.

# EJS tags
-> <% 'Scriptlet' tag, for control-flow, no output
-> <%_ ‘Whitespace Slurping’ Scriptlet tag, strips all whitespace before it
-> <%= Outputs the value into the template (HTML escaped)
-> <%- Outputs the unescaped value into the template
-> <%# Comment tag, no execution, no output
-> <%% Outputs a literal '<%'
-> %> Plain ending tag
-> -%> Trim-mode ('newline slurp') tag, trims following newline
-> _%> ‘Whitespace Slurping’ ending tag, removes all whitespace after it

# Passing data to EJS 
Eg:
app.get("/rolldice",(req,res) =>{
    let num = Math.floor(Math.random()*6)+1;
    res.render("rolldice.ejs",{ diceVal: num });
});
//rolldice.ejs 
<h1>Your dice gave value: <%= diceVal %></h1>
-> Here we are passing the value as a second parameter to res.render and we are passing it in the form of { key: value }
-> We are adding it to our rolldice.ejs page using <%= key %>.

# How to use conditional statements in EJS 
// Adding conditions inside EJS 
-> Eg:
<% if(diceVal == 6){ %>
<h2>Nice! Roll dice again.</h2>
<% } %>
// Here if the value of dice will be 6 then only this <h2> statement will be printed else not.

# How to use loops in EJS?
-> Eg:
<% for(user of followers) { %>
<li><%= users %>
<% } %>  
followers =["adam","Viper","Suraj","Harsh"]; // this followers are passed in index.js  while working on a website we will get it from the database.
