# BSON Data 
-> Binary JSON :in mongoDB the data is stored in BSON format.
-> There were some of the issues in the JSON format that are solved by the BSON format.
# JSON 
  -> Text based data : parsing of text based data is difficult .
  -> Space inefficient
  -> Less datatypes
  -> Readability: Human & Machine
# BSON 
  -> It doesn't store data in text based format so it solves the problem of parsing text data.
  -> Space efficient 
  -> More datatypes
  -> Readability: Machine

// We pass the data in json format only but mongo converts it into the BSON format.

# Collections 
-> Document : Mongo stores data in form of documents (BSON data).
-> Collection : MongoDB stores documents in collections.

# INSERT in DB 
-> insertOne 
   db.collection.insertOne()   //Inserts a single document into a collection.
