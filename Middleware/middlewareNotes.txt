# Middleware 
-> It is an intermediary .
// Request -----> Middlware ------> Response 
-> In express Middleware in express are functions that come into play after the server recieves the request and before the response is sent to the client.
-> Common middleware funcitons: 
   // methodOverride
   // bodyParser 
   // express.static 
   // express.urlencoded 
-> app.use(express.urlencoded({extended: true}));
-> app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname,"/public")));

# Properties of middleware
-> Middleware can access req and res object
-> Chaining is also possible in middleware.
-> If middleware want it can stop the chaining by sending a response.
Eg: const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

//middleware -> response send

app.get("/",(req,res)=>{
    res.send();
});
// If we send a req to "/" and there is a middleware present before the app.get is also sending a response then the response of the middleware will be sent
