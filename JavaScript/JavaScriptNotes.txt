# JAVASCRIPT
-> JavaScript is the programming language of the Web.
-> Used to program the behavior of web pages.

# Using the console
// Uses REPL(Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop)
-> Open the browser inspect and open the console.
-> Code we write on console is temporary it will be removed as soon as we refresh the page.
-> To clear the console om windows use ctrl+L .

# Variables
-> A variable is simply the name of a storage location where we store our data.
Eg: a=10 // Here a is a variable whose value is 10

# Data Types In JS 
1. Primitive Types
// We can use typeof operator to check the type of the data .
-> JS automatically detects the typeof variable.
Eg: typeof variableName
-> Number
  -> Positive(14) & negative(-4)
  -> Integers(45,-50)
  ->Floating numbers - with decimal(4.6,-8.9)
     Eg: a=10 //a is a number 
  
  # Operation in JS
  -> Addition
  Eg: a=20 b=10
      sum=a+b //a & b are operands & + is operator
  -> Subtraction
  Eg: a=20 b=10
      diff=a-b
  -> Multiplication
  Eg: mul=a*b
  -> Division
  Eg: div=a/b 
  -> Modulo(Remainder operator)
  Eg: 12 % 5=10
  -> Exponentiation( Power operator)
  Eg: 2**3=8

 # Operator Precedence
 -> This is the general order of solving an expression.
 order: ( ) > ** > *,/,% > +,-
 -> Highest priority is of ( ) & lowest is +,-

-> Boolean
  -> Bollean represents a truth value-> true/false/yes/no
  Eg: let age=23;
      let isAdult=true;

-> String
Eg: name="Tony" // Name is a string 
-> Undefined
-> Null
-> Bigint
-> Symbol

# NaN IN JS 
-> The NaN global property is a value representing Not-A-Number.
-> typeof NaN is number but the number it is representing is not a valid number.
-> Basically NaN is just a invalid number
Eg: 0/0 //0 but it's type is NaN 
   NaN-1 //NaN
   NaN*1 //NaN
   NaN+NaN //NaN

# let keyword
-> Syntax of declaring Variables.
-> In max cass we will be using let keyword to declare a variable.
Eg: let age=23;    let cgpa;
   age=age+1;      cgpa=8.9;

# const keyword 
-> values of constants can't be changes with re-assignment & they can't be re-declared
Eg: const year= 2025;    const pi=3.14;
    year=2026 //Error    const g=9.8;
    year=year+1 //Error

# var keyword
-> Old syntax of writing Variables
Eg: var age=23;
    var cpgpa=8.9;

# Assignment Operator
-> It is used to assign a value to a variable. 
-> age=age+1 / age+=1

# Unary Operators
-> Unaray operators require one operand .
Eg: age+=1 // 1 operand age
    age++; //Increment operator
    age--; //decrement operator 
# Pre-Increment( change then use)
-> let age = 10;
   lete newAge= ++age;

# Post-increment(use then change)
-> let age=10;
let newAge= age++;

# Identifier Rules
-> All JS variables must be identified with unique names (identifiers)
   -> Names can contain letters, digits , underscores and dollor signs .(no space)
   -> Name must begin with a letter.
   -> Names can laso begin with $ and  _ .
   -> Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables).
   -> Reserved words cn't be used as names.

# camelCase
-> way of writing identifiers.
Eg: camelCase(JS naming convention): let fullName;
    snake_case: let full_name;
    PascalCase: let FullName;
