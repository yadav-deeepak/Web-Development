# JAVASCRIPT
-> JavaScript is the programming language of the Web.
-> Used to program the behavior of web pages.

# Using the console
// Uses REPL(Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop)
-> Open the browser inspect and open the console.
-> Code we write on console is temporary it will be removed as soon as we refresh the page.
-> To clear the console om windows use ctrl+L .

# Variables
-> A variable is simply the name of a storage location where we store our data.
Eg: a=10 // Here a is a variable whose value is 10

# Data Types In JS 
1. Primitive Types
// We can use typeof operator to check the type of the data .
-> JS automatically detects the typeof variable.
Eg: typeof variableName
-> Number
  -> Positive(14) & negative(-4)
  -> Integers(45,-50)
  ->Floating numbers - with decimal(4.6,-8.9)
     Eg: a=10 //a is a number 
  
  # Operation in JS
  -> Addition
  Eg: a=20 b=10
      sum=a+b //a & b are operands & + is operator
  -> Subtraction
  Eg: a=20 b=10
      diff=a-b
  -> Multiplication
  Eg: mul=a*b
  -> Division
  Eg: div=a/b 
  -> Modulo(Remainder operator)
  Eg: 12 % 5=10
  -> Exponentiation( Power operator)
  Eg: 2**3=8

 # Operator Precedence
 -> This is the general order of solving an expression.
 order: ( ) > ** > *,/,% > +,-
 -> Highest priority is of ( ) & lowest is +,-

-> Boolean
  -> Bollean represents a truth value-> true/false/yes/no
  Eg: let age=23;
      let isAdult=true;

 # String
  -> Strings are text or sequence of characters 
  -> Anything written inside a single quote(' ') is string. 
     Eg: let name="Tony" // name is a string 
         let num='123'; // typeof num is string
 
  # String Indices
  -> let name = "TONY STARK";
  -> To find the length of the string we use 
  Eg: name.length // 10 (return the length of string)
  -> T O N Y   S T A R K 
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  //0 based indexing
     name[0]-> 'T' name[1]-> 'O' name[2]-> 'N' name[3]-> 'Y' name[4]-> ' ' 
     name[5]-> 'S' name[6]-> 'T' name[7]-> 'A' name[8]-> 'R' name[9]-> 'K' 

  # Concatenation
  -> Adding strings together.
  Eg: "tony" + " " + "stark" = "tony stark"

# Undefined
-> A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined.
Eg: let a; // type of a is undefined

# Null
-> The null value represents the intentional absence of any object value.
-> To be explicitly assigned.
Eg: let a =null; // type of a is 'object' and value is null

-> Bigint
-> Symbol

# NaN IN JS 
-> The NaN global property is a value representing Not-A-Number.
-> typeof NaN is number but the number it is representing is not a valid number.
-> Basically NaN is just a invalid number
Eg: 0/0 //0 but it's type is NaN 
   NaN-1 //NaN
   NaN*1 //NaN
   NaN+NaN //NaN

# let keyword
-> Syntax of declaring Variables.
-> In max cass we will be using let keyword to declare a variable.
Eg: let age=23;    let cgpa;
   age=age+1;      cgpa=8.9;

# const keyword 
-> values of constants can't be changes with re-assignment & they can't be re-declared
Eg: const year= 2025;    const pi=3.14;
    year=2026 //Error    const g=9.8;
    year=year+1 //Error

# var keyword
-> Old syntax of writing Variables
Eg: var age=23;
    var cpgpa=8.9;

# Assignment Operator
-> It is used to assign a value to a variable. 
-> age=age+1 / age+=1

# Unary Operators
-> Unaray operators require one operand .
Eg: age+=1 // 1 operand age
    age++; //Increment operator
    age--; //decrement operator 
# Pre-Increment( change then use)
-> let age = 10;
   lete newAge= ++age;

# Post-increment(use then change)
-> let age=10;
let newAge= age++;

# Identifier Rules
-> All JS variables must be identified with unique names (identifiers)
   -> Names can contain letters, digits , underscores and dollor signs .(no space)
   -> Name must begin with a letter.
   -> Names can laso begin with $ and  _ .
   -> Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables).
   -> Reserved words cn't be used as names.

# camelCase
-> way of writing identifiers.
Eg: camelCase(JS naming convention): let fullName;
    snake_case: let full_name;
    PascalCase: let FullName;

# TypeScript
-> Static Typed, whwere JS is dynamic typed.
-> Designed by Microsoft
Eg: TS -> a=5; a=true;//this will give error once a data type is declared it can't be changed.
Js -> a=5; a=true; //this will not give error as JS is dynamically typed.

# console.log()
-> To write(log) a message on the console.
-> It links the console of browser to the js file.
Eg: console.log("Suraj");
    console.log("Viper");

# Linking JS file
-> To link js file with html we use <script> tag.
-> Syntax: <script src="app.js"></script> 
-> We link the js file just before the closing of body tag.

# Comments in JS
-> To write comments in js we write 2 forward slash before the statement/ or we can use ctrl+/ 
-> Comments can't be seen in the console window.
Eg: // console.log("Hello JavaScript!");

# Template Literals
-> They are used to add embedded expressions in the string.
-> Back ticks are used (` `).
Eg: let a=5;
    let b=10;
    console.log(`Your pay ${a+b} rupees`);

# Operators in  JS

1. Arithmetic (+,-,*,/,%,**)
2. Unary (++,--)
3. Assignment (=,+=,*=,-=,/=,%=)

4. Comparison Operators 
-> To compare 2 values.
-> Returns true/ false or 0/1  
     >,>=,<.<=,==,!=
-> == ( double equalto) ignore the type of the variable it just compare value.
Eg: let a =5;// number
    let str='5';//string
    a==str;// true
-> So when we want to compare type and value both we use === ( tripple equalto) operator.
Eg:  let a =5;// number
    let str='5';//string
    a===str;// false

   # Comparison for non-numbers
   ->'a'<'A' // false 
   -> Each character has its own ASCII number.So when we compare characters these ASCII values are compared.
   -> 'a'- 61 , 'b'- 62,....
    'A' - 41 , 'B'- 42,....

5. Logical Operators 
-> Logical operators to combine expressions.
-> If we have multiple logical operators in a single expression then we solve it from left to right.
1. && (Logical AND): (exp1) && (exp2)
-> Gives true when both exp1 and exp2 are true.

2. || (Logical OR): (exp1) || (exp2)
-> Gives true when any one of expression is true.

3. ! (Logical NOT): !(exp)
-> If exp is true !exp returns false /exp is false then !exp returns true. 

# truthy & falsy
-> Everything in JS is true /False(in boolean context).
-> This doesn't mean their value itself is false or true, but they are treated as flase /true if taken in boolean context.
// FALSY values
-> false, 0, -0,0n(Bigint value),""(empty string),null,undefined,NaN

// TRUTHY values
-> Everything else

# Conditional statements
-> if-else
   Syntax: if(condition){
           statement; //condition is true
           }  
           else if(condition) { //if above condition is not true then this condition will be checked
            statement;
           }  
           else statement; //when all of the above conditions are false then else statement is executed 

-> nested if-else
   -> Nesting is writing if else inside  if else statements.It can have many levels.
   Syntax: if(condition){
                 if(condition){
                    statement;
                 } 
                 else statement;
            }
            else statement;

-> switch statement
   -> Used when we have some fixed values that we need to compare to.
   Syntax: switch(condition){
               case 1 : statement;
                        break;
               case 2 : statement;
                        break;
               default : statement; //When all the case are flase then default statement run.   
           }  

# ALERT & PROMPT
->Alert displays an alert message on the page.
Eg: alert("Something's wrong");

-> Prompt displays a dialogue box that asks user for some input.
Eg: prompt("Please enter your rollno."); 

# console.error("Error message");
-> This is used to show an error mssg on the console.

# console.warn("Warning!");
-> This is used to show a warning mssg on console.

# String Methods
-> Methods - Actions that can be performed on objects.
SyntaX: stringName.method();

# trim()
-> str.trim();
-> Trims whitespaces from both ends of string & returns a new one.
Eg: let msg="   HELLO   ";
    msg.trim(); // 'HELLO'
    -> Output will be 'HELLO' but value of msg remains same "   HELLO   "

# Strings are Immutable in JS
-> No changes can be made to strings.
-> Whenever we do try to make a change ,a new string is created and old one remians same. 

# toUpperCase()
-> str.toUpperCase();
-> It is used to convert the string into uppercase.
Eg: let a="hello";
    a.toUpperCase(); //'HELLO'

# toLowerCase()
-> str.toLowerCase();
-> It is used to convert the string into lowercase.
Eg: let a ="HELLO";
    a.toLowerCase();// 'hello'

# String Methods with arguments
-> Argument is a some value that we pass to the method.
-> Format: stringName.method(arg);
  
  1. indexOf()
  -> Returns the first index of occurrem=nce of some value in string or gives -1 if not found.
  -> This method returns the first occurrence of the variable.
  -> let str ="ILoveCoding";
     str.indexOf("Love"); //1
     str.indexOf("j"); // -1 (not found)
     str.indexOf("o") // 2(only 1 index)

  2. slice()
  -> Returns a part of the orignal string as a new string.
  Eg:  let str ="ILoveCoding";
       str.slice(5); // "Coding" from 5th index till last index value will be printed
       str.slice(1,5) //"Love" 1to 4 str will be printed
       str.slice(-num) = str.slice(length-num)

# Method Chaining
-> Using one method after another. Order of execution will be left to right.
Eg: str.toUpperCase().trim();

# replace() 
-> Searches a value in the string & returns a new string with the value replaced.
-> The first occurrence gets replaced
Eg: let str = "ILoveCoding";
    str.replace("love","do"); //"IdoCoding"

# repeat() 
-> Returns a string with the number of copies of a string.
Eg: let str ="Mango";
str.repeat(3); //"MangoMangoMango"

# Array (Data structure)
-> Linear collection of things.
-> In JS arrays are of object type.
Synatax: let students =["viper" , "suraj" ,"deepak"];
-> To access the data in array we use indexes
Eg: students[1]; // "suraj"

# Visualizing Array
-> let nums =[2,3,5,7];
              0 1 2 3  //index
-> To access an array element we can use index number.
   nums[0]=2
   nums[1]=3
   typeof(nums); //object

# Creating arrays
-> let marks=[99 , 89 , 67 , 100];
-> let students =["viper" , "suraj" ,"deepak"];
-> let info = ["Viper" , 25 , 9.9]; //Mixed array
// Empty Array
-> let newArr = [];
-> We can get the size of array by using 
  //arr.length();

# Arrays are Mutable
-> This means that value of an element in array can be changed and no new array will be created.
Eg: let fruits =['MANGO" , "APPLE" , "LITCHI"];
    fruits[0] = "banana";
    //fruits=["banana" , "APPLE" , "LITCHI"]
    fruits[10]="orange";
-> The spaces we left will be counted as empty spaces in array .
  fruits=["banana" , "APPLE" , empty*7 , "LITCHI"]

# Array Method
   1. Push: add to end.
   2. Pop: delete from end & returns it
   3. Unshift: add to start.
   4. shift: delete from start & returns it.
   Eg: 
       let cars =["audi","bmw","xuv","maruti"];
       console.log(cars); //['audi', 'bmw', 'xuv', 'maruti']
       cars.push("toyota");
       cars.push("ferrari");
       console.log(cars);//['audi', 'bmw', 'xuv', 'maruti', 'toyota', 'ferrari']
       cars.pop(); //Returns ferrari
       console.log(cars);// ['audi', 'bmw', 'xuv', 'maruti', 'toyota']
       cars.unshift("ferrari");
       console.log(cars);//['ferrari', 'audi', 'bmw', 'xuv', 'maruti', 'toyota']
       cars.shift();// Returns ferrari
       console.log(cars);//['audi', 'bmw', 'xuv', 'maruti', 'toyota']
    
    5. indexOf: returns index of somenthing
       Eg: let primary =['red','yellow','green'];
           console.log(primary.indexOf('yellow'));

    6. includes: search for a value
       Eg: primary.includes("red"); //true

    7. concat: merge 2 arrays.
       Eg: primary.concat(secondary);//merges secondary array with primary array.

    8. reverse: reverse an array.
       -> Changes are not done in existing array a new array is created we can use it by storing it in another variable. 
      Eg: primary.reverse();//['green','yellow','red'];

    9. slice: Copies a portion of an array.
       syntax: slice(start,end);
       -> returns value from start to end-1.
       Eg: let color = ["red","yellow","blue","orange","pink","white"];
       color.slice();//["red","yellow","blue","orange","pink","white"]
       color.slice(2);// ["blue","orange","pink","white"]
       color.slice(2,3);// ["blue"]
       color.sloce(-2);// ["pink","white"] last se  2 elements return hojaayenge
      
    10. splice: removes/replaces/add elements in 
        place.
        -> It's changes are applied into the orignal array
        -> It returns the array of elements deleted
        Synatax: splice(start,deleteCount,item0......itemN)
        Eg: color.splice(4);//returns ["pink","white"]
            color // ["red","yellow","blue","orange"]
            color.splice(0,1);// returns ["red"]
            color //["yellow","blue","orange"]
            color.splice(0,1,"black","grey"); //returns ['yellow']
            color //["black","grey","blue","orange"]
    
    sort: sorts an array
    -> It first converts into string and then sort it. That is the reason why numbers are not sorted properly.
    -> We use sort when we have to sort characters or string elements.
    Eg: let days =["moday","sunday","wednesday","tuesday"];
        days.sort(); // ["moday","sunday","tuesday","wednesday"] sorted in alphabetical order
        let squares =[25,16,4,49,36,9];
        squares.sort(); // [16,25,36,4,49,9]

# Array References
-> References means address in memory.
Eg: "name" == "name" //true
    [1] == [1] // false
    [] == [] //false
-> The above 2 values are false due to array references.
-> Whenever an array is created an reference variable is created in JS 
Eg: let nums = [1,2,3];
// Here nums is a reference variable which will be used to acces the array elements.
    let arr1 = [1];
    let arr2 =[1];
    // arr1 & arr2 has the menory addres of its first variable not the value [1] that is the reason why we will get false when we compare arr1 ==arr2 //False
    
Eg2: let arr1 = ['a','b'];
     let arrCopy = arr1;
     arrCopy.push('c');
     console.log(arr1); //['a','b','c']
     console.log(arr1==arrCopy); //true
-> So here arrCopy has same address as arr1 so it is giving true when arr1==arrCopy
-> Any changes done in arrCopy will be reflected in arr1.

# Constant arrays
-> const arr=[1,2,3,4];
-> When we create a constant array then we can increase or decrease its length but we can't change the array completely.
-> This means that variable name arr becomes constant
the address that is stored in arr remains same it can't be changed.

# Nested Arrays / Multi dimensional arrays
-> Arrays of array
Eg: let nums =[[2,4],[3,6],[4,8]];
    console.log(nums); //(3) [Array(2), Array(2), Array(2)]
    console.log(nums.length);//3
    nums[0][0];//2
    nums[0][1];//4

# Loops
-> Loops are used when we want to perform same task multiple times.
-> Loops are used to iterate a piece of work.

# for loops
-> Syntax: for(initialization ; condition; updation){
                 //do Something
            }
Eg: for(let i=0;i<=5;i++){
    console.log(i);
}

# Infinte lopps
-> When condition in loop is missing or is never ending then it will create a never ending loop known as infinite loop.
Eg: for( let i=1;i>=0;i++){
    }
    for(let i=1;i<=5;i--){
    }
    for(let i=1;  ; i++){
    }

# parseInt()
-> It is used to return the number part of the input.
-> If we take input from prompt it takes input in form of string so if we want to convert it to number we can use it.
Eg: let n = prompt("Enter your number");
        n= parseInt(n);


# Nested for loop
-> For loop inside for loop
-> for(let i=1;i<=3;i++){
      for(let j=1;j<=3;j++){
        console.log(j);
      }
   }

# while loop
-> Syntax: while(condition){
             //do something
            }
    Eg: let i=1;
    while(i<=5){
        console.log(i);
        i++;
    } 

# break keyword
-> It helps us to get out of the lopp execution.
Eg: let i=1;
while(i<=5){
   if(i==3){ // As soon as i gets 3 the loop will break.
      break;
   }
   console.log(i);
   i++;
}

# Loops with arrays
-> let fruits = ["mango","apple","banana","litchi","orange"];
// We can access array elements using for loop //
for(let i=0;i<fruits.length;i++){
    console.log(i, fruits[i]);
}

# Nested loops with nested arrays
-> let heroes = [["ironman","spiderman","thor"],["superman","wonderwoman","flash"]];

for(let i=0;i<heroes.length;i++){
    console.log(`List #${i}`);
    for(int j=0;j<heroes[i].length;j++){
        console.log(heroes[i][j]);
    }
}

# for of loop 
-> for(element of collection){
    //do something
}
Eg: let fruits = ["mango","apple","banana","litchi","orange"];
for( fruit of fruits){
    console.log(fruit);
} 

# Nested for of loop
-> let heroes = [["ironman","spiderman","thor"],["superman","wonderwoman","flash"]];
for(list of heroes){
    for(hero of list){
        console.log(hero);
    }
}

# Object Literals
-> Used to store keyed collections & complex entities.
-> property=>(key,value)parseInt
-> Objects are collection of properties.
Eg: student
   name  "Deepak"  //property1
   age    22      //property2
   marks  6.9     //property3
   key    value

// student is a object with name age and marks as its property in the form of key value pair.

# Creating object Literals
Eg: let delhi = {
    latitude: "22.7041 N",
    longitude: "77.1025 E"
};
-> const student = { 
     name: "Viper",
     age: 23,
     marks: 6.9,
     city: "Delhi"
};
-> The object literal created with const will have its address as constant and we can change any of the propert value according to our need.

// We can also use arrays inside objects
Eg: const item ={
   price: 100.99,
   discount: 50,
   colors: ["red","pink"]
};

# Get values
-> let student ={
    name: "Viper",
    marks: "94.4
};
// We can access it by following ways
   student["name"]  //objectName["key"]
   student.name     //objectName.key
-> objectName["key"]
   We use this method when we need to use a variable to access the object data.
   Eg: let prop = "repost";
      post[prop];
    //We can access it like this but we can't use variable like this in objectName.key method
-> objectName.key 
   We use this when we want to access the content of object without using another variable.
   Eg: post.repost;

-> JS automatically converts objects keys to strings.
-> Even if we made number as a key , the number will be converted to string.

# Add / Update value
-> let student = {
    name: 'Viper',
    age: 23,
    marks: 9.9,
    city: "Delhi"
};
=> Change the city to 'Mumbai"
   student.city = "Mumbai";

=> Add a new property gender: "Male"
   student.gender;
   student.gender= "Male";

=> Chnage the marks to "A"
   student.marks='A';

# Delete a key value pair
-> delete objectName.keyName;
-> Returns ture if key is deleted successfully else false.

# Object of Objects
-> Storing information of multiple students.
Eg: const classInfo = {
    aman : {
        grade: "A",
        city: "Delhi"
    },
    viper : {
        grade: "A+",
        city: "Banglore"
    },
    Suraj : {
        grade: "A",
        city: "Mumbai"
    }

};

# Array of objects
-> Storing information of multiple students.
Eg: const classInfo = [{name: "viper",age: 21,city: "Delhi"},{name: "suraj",age: 20,city: "Lucknow"},{name: "harsh",age: 21,city: "Noida"}];

# Math Object
-> Properies         
   Math.PI -> It is used to give the value of pi.
   Eg: Math.PI; // 3.141592653...         
   Math.E -> It is used to return the value of the constant E.
   Eg: Math.E; //2.7182818284...

->Methods      
   Math.abs(n) -> It is used to return the absolute value of a number.
   Eg: Math.abs(12); //12 
       Math.abs(-12); //12             
   Math.pow(a,b) -> It is used to calculate the power of a number.
   Eg: Math.pow(2,3); //8               
   Math.floor(n) -> This is used to roundoff the value to the nearest smallest integer value.
   Eg: Math.floor(5.5); //5
       Math.floor(5.999); //5
   Math.ceil(n) -> This is used to roundoff the value to the largest nearest integer value.
   Eg: Math.ceil(5.9); //6  
   Math.random() -> It is used to return the random number between 0 & 1 (where 1 is exclusive it is not included).
   Eg: Math.random(); //generates Random number 

   # Random Integers 
   -> From 1 to 10
   step1: let num = Math.random();
   step2: num = num*10;
   step3: num = Math.floor(num);
   step4: num = num+1;
