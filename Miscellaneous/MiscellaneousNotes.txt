# Get & Post requests 
-> Get: used to Get some response 
     -> data sent in query strings (limited, string data & visible in URL).

-> Post: used to Post something (for create/write/Update)
      -> data sent via request body (any type of data).

// When we sent data with get request the data is visible in the url.
// When we sent data with post request then it is not visible in the url the data is sent with form body.
-> So when we have to send some data then we send it with post request but when we want to get some data form the server then we use get request.

// To get the response write the full url (http://localhost:3000/register) in the form action attribute then we can get the response.

# How to access the data in backend when we are using get request?
app.get("/register",(req,res)=>{
    let {user , password} = req.query;
    res.send(`Standard get response .Welcome ${user}`);
});
// the data is sent with url in the form of query so we can use req.query to get the data.

# Handling Post Request 
->Setup Post request route to get some response 
-> Parse Post request data 
Eg: app.use(express.urlencoded({extended: true})); // this middleware is use by express to read the urlencoded data.
// This means that if any data comes then express will encode it and it will understand it .
// After using this we will get the data by using req.body;
Eg: console.log(req.body); 
-> But right now the express is only able to read the urlencoded data only. So, if we want express to be able to read the json data also then we can use this middleware also.
app.use(express.json()); // When we use this then express will be able to read the json format data also.
-> If we don't use any middleware then by default the req.body will show undefined it will not be able to read data.
 
# Revisiting JS 
## Object Oriented Programming 
-> To structure our code 
   -> prototypes
   -> New operator 
   -> constructors 
   -> classes 
   -> keywords(extends,super) 
// Suppose we want to store the data of students in an object for 1 student we can create 1 object but for 1000 student we will not create 1000 object .
// We will create a template/blueprint with the structure of student object with keys and methods and then we can use it for all the 1000 students. 
// This blueprint is called as class.

# Object Prototypes
-> Every object in js has a buit-in property , which is called its prototype. 
-> Prototypes are the mechanism by which JS objects inherit features from one another.
-> It is like a single template object that all objects inherit methods and properties from without having their own copy.
//  If we want to see the prototype objects then we have to write this:
Eg: arr.__proto__(reference) : using this we can access the reference prototype object.
    Array.prototype(actual object) : using this we can access the actual prototype object .
    String.prototype : this will give the prototype objects for string.

// We can also change the function of any of the prototype 
Eg: arr.__proto__.push = (n) => {console.log("Pushing number",n);}
// This will change the function of the arr.push now when we use it it will give the output as Pushing number number
-> So if we want we can access the proto and change its definition.

'abc'.toUpperCase ==='xyz'.toUpperCase //true
arr1.sayHello() === arr2.sayHello() // False
// First one is true because it is a prototype function both abc and xyz are using the same toUppperCase function but in second one both are using different sayHello() both arr1 and arr2 has its own copy of sayHello() function.

# Factory Functions
-> A function that creates objects.
Eg: function personMaker(name,age){
    const person={
        name: name,
        age: age,
        talk() {
            console.log(`Hi my name is ${this.name}`);
        }
    };
    return person;
} // Here as it is creating the objects that is why it is known as factory function.
-> Now we can use it to create the person object just by calling this function. We can create 1000 of objects just by calling the function. 
Eg: let p1 = personMaker('Suraj',20);
// We can access its value by using . operator 
// p1.name (this will give the name of the person) similiarly we can access its age and we can call talk() also p1.talk();

Note: But this is not the efficient way because if we create object for 1000 person then it will take memory for 1000 objects with each object having its own space for talk() this is the reason why it is not so efficient.
// We are trying to achieve that we create the template for once and then use it for other without using extra spaces. There is better way to achieve this using new operator.

# New Operator 
-> The new operator lets developers create an instance of a user-defined object type or of one of the built-in object types that has a contructor function. 
-> If we want to create a new object using the constructor then we use new operator to create it.
-> Using constructors , constructors starts with capital letter and it doesn't return anything.
Eg: function Person(name,age){
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
}

Person.prototype.talk = function () {
    console.log(`Hi , my name is ${this.name}`);
};

let p1 = new Person("adam",25);
let p2 = new Person("eve",24);
// Here we are using constructors and it is doing the same work that factory function was doing but it is doing it in a better way.
// If we create a function inside the Person then it will not create copy of the function for the 2 different object p1 and p2 it will refer to the same copy.
